# Understanding HTML Elements

- HTML is a "Markup Language"
- `<h1>Hello World!</h1>` HTML Element is made up of HTML Tags and Element Content
- `<h1></h1>` Opening Tag and Closing Tag
- `h1` Element Name
- `Hello World!` Element Content

# Working with "font-size" and "px" - Day-04
- Absolute `px` A device-independent pixel on the screen
- Relative `rem`, `%`

# Styling the Image & Using the Body Tag
- `border-radius: 100px` makes a circle because it is half the width of `width:200px; height:200px`
- `text-align: center` align the content not the element

# A Word About File Name Conventions
There's also one important characteristic which you maybe noticed about all these filenames: They are all lowercase.

And that's important! Whilst it's technically not required, it is a very common convention that you name your files all-lowercase, with no special characters except for dashes (-). If your file name consists of multiple words, you should NOT separate them with blanks (whitespace) but instead use dashes. So use `online-shop.html` instead of `Online Shop.html`.

# Learning Check: More HTML & CSS Features
## What's a "pseudo-selector"?
- A CSS selector like :hover that allows you to set styles for an element that fulfils a certain condition (e.g. the mouse cursor hovers over it).
## Why is it called "Cascading Style Sheets"
- Because more than one CSS rule may apply to the same element.
## What's special about the <img> element?
- It has no content, it's configured with attributes only.
## Which of the following file names would be a good choice for a second HTML file that shows some contact details about the page owner?
- `contact.html`
